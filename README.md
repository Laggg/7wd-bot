## RL agent for board card game «7 Wonders: Duel»

![](demo/7wd_1.png)

We present our bot (based on reinforcement learning algorithms) for board card game «7 Wonders: Duel» embedded in this [online platform](https://7wd.io/welcome).
Our approach is similar to the [DeepMind's AlphaGo solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1BELqFQZVM&ab_channel=TheAIEpiphany):
we use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Behavior Cloning (BC) learners.
